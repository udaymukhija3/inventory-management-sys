# Resume Bullets - Product + Tech Balance (Verified)

## 🚀 The "Product + Tech" Blend (Recommended)

**1. Enterprise Inventory Platform (The "Core Product")**
*   **What I Built**: A distributed inventory platform capable of **real-time stock synchronization** and automated reordering across disparate warehouses.
*   **How I Built It**: Architected **4 independent microservices** (Spring Boot, FastAPI) with **50+ REST endpoints**, utilizing **Kafka** event streaming to decouple complex business logic and ensure data consistency.
*   **Impact**: Enabled accurate global inventory tracking and eliminated manual stock reconciliation.

> **Resume Line**: Built a distributed inventory platform delivering **real-time stock synchronization** by architecting 4 independent microservices with **50+ REST endpoints**, using **Kafka** event streaming to decouple complex business logic and automate reordering workflows.

**2. Automated Data Quality & Reliability (The "Data Product")**
*   **What I Built**: An automated data reliability system that guarantees the integrity of daily inventory reports without manual intervention.
*   **How I Built It**: Engineered **5 production Apache Airflow DAGs** with custom validation operators that intercept and flag bad data before it hits the warehouse.
*   **Impact**: Successfully automated the detection of **5+ critical anomaly types** (e.g., negative inventory, stockouts) and ensured 100% reliable reporting for decision-making.

> **Resume Line**: Delivered 100% reliable daily inventory reporting by engineering **5 Apache Airflow DAGs** that automatically validate data quality, detecting **5+ critical anomaly types** (e.g., negative inventory) before they impact downstream analytics.

**3. Operational Visibility System (The "Ops Product")**
*   **What I Built**: A centralized monitoring dashboard that provides instant visibility into system health and key performance indicators.
*   **How I Built It**: Deployed a comprehensive observability stack (**Prometheus, Grafana**) tracking custom **Spring Boot Actuator** metrics across **20+ containerized services**.
*   **Impact**: Reduced time-to-detection for system issues and provided actionable insights into API performance and resource usage.

> **Resume Line**: Created a centralized operations dashboard providing instant health visibility across **20+ services** by implementing **Prometheus & Grafana**, utilizing custom **Spring Boot Actuator** metrics to reduce incident response time.

**4. High-Performance API Layer (The "Performance Product")**
*   **What I Built**: A high-speed API layer ensuring instant data access for customer-facing product and search features.
*   **How I Built It**: Designed a **Redis cache-aside strategy** for **7 frequently accessed methods** and optimized PostgreSQL indexing paths.
*   **Impact**: Achieved **sub-10ms latency targets** for critical read operations, ensuring a seamless user experience even under load.

> **Resume Line**: Engineered a high-speed data access layer achieving **sub-10ms response targets** by implementing **Redis caching** across **7 core methods** and optimizing PostgreSQL strategies to minimize database load for critical user-facing features.

## ⚖️ Why This Balance Works

This format appeals to both **Engineering Managers** (who care about the "How") and **Product Leaders** (who care about the "What").

| Bullet | The "What" (Product Value) | The "How" (Tech Implementation) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1** | Real-time stock sync | Microservices, Kafka, 50+ endpoints |
| **2** | Reliable daily reporting | Airflow DAGs, Anomaly Detection |
| **3** | Instant health visibility | Prometheus, Grafana, 20+ services |
| **4** | Sub-10ms data access | Redis Caching, Postgres Indexing |
